# BlobPlatformer
My first platformer game, made in C++ and using raylib.

# Build instructions
Since I'm creating this game on macOS, the build is only available on this platform.\n
You have to clone this repo : \n
`git clone https://github.com/ABFStudio/BlobPlatformer.git`\n
Then build it using the Makefile\n
`make`\n
`./blob`\n
