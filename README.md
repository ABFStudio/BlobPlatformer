# BlobPlatformer
My first platformer game, made in C++ and using raylib.

#Build instructions
Since I'm creating this game on macOS, the build is only available on this platform.
You have to clone this repo :
`git clone https://github.com/ABFStudio/BlobPlatformer.git`
Then build it using the Makefile
`make`
`./blob`
