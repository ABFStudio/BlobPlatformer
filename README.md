# BlobPlatformer
My first platformer game, made in C++ and using raylib.

# Build instructions
Since I'm creating this game on macOS, the build is only available on this platform.<br />
You have to clone this repo : <br />
`git clone https://github.com/ABFStudio/BlobPlatformer.git`<br />
Then build it using the Makefile<br />
`make`<br />
`./blob`<br />
